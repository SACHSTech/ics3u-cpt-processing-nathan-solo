# Escape Room

The main objective of the game is to simply escape the room. In order to do so, you will have to interact with different objects, solve clues, and uncover mysteries. You will have to click on different objects for them to do something that can help you solve a puzzle or drag and make different objects interact with each other to produce something or to solve something. You may also need to solve and play mini games in order to proceed further into the game. These things can be done so by moving your mouse and clicking or dragging, using the arrow keys, and pressing different keys. There will also be a function that allows you to get a hint at each step of the way. There will be a timer that will time how long it takes for the player to complete the game as well as the amount of hints they have used. There will also be limitations so that the player cannot just randomly guess and click things to proceed further on. There will not be a penalty for guessing however when the player does something before what they are supposed to do the object will just not interact.
